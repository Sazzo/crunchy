Crunchy is an extension that allows you to use jwplayer to watch any anime on Crunchyroll. This extension was originally done by Itallo Legal and as he ended up deleting everything related, this is a repost.

First of all, yes, it allows you to watch any anime on Crunchyroll for free because of the nature of how the extension works, it was reported to the platform's vulnerability program and the report was denied which they say they didn't find anything, be warned. This can break at any time.
